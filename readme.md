# Development Project Test

## Instructions

- Clone (Download) this project to your desktop, it includes:
	- a Project Assets directory
	- A LINK TO THE XD FILE: https://drive.google.com/file/d/18nHEX0M679y3O87Dcw-lWcR5uR59ekYz/view?usp=sharing
- If you would prefer you can create a fork of this repository and work with that. 

Please download and use the XD file as reference to create your test webpage. *You may use a free trail of adobe xd for 7 days*   
I highly recommend you do this, there is a lot of helpful information contained in the xd file such as font size and colors.

Adobe XD trial: https://www.adobe.com/in/products/xd/pricing/free-trial.html

*Along with the XD file we are including a prototype link* to the design.  This is a live version of the design from the cd file. 

If you have issues with XD you may use this as reference, and along with the included assets should have what is needed to create your webpage.

*Prototype*: https://xd.adobe.com/view/342e80db-01e4-4574-8e06-5334c8171585-617d/ 

## Further Notes:
1. You are not required to use a specific CSS framework.  

Please use your own solution to create a working webpage from this design. 

2. We are looking to see how you achieve the goal and how closely it resembles our design files. 

3. Your form does not need to be a functioning contact form. Please just code a form.  The ability for it to gather and store messages is not required. 

4. We use a js slider named Swiper (you can test it if you would like, it may help in creating the sliders on this design)
